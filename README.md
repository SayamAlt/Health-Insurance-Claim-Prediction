## Problem Statement

<p>A key challenge for the insurance industry is to charge each customer an appropriate premium for the risk they represent. The ability to predict a correct claim amount has a significant impact on insurer's management decisions and financial statements. Predicting the cost of claims in an insurance company is a real-life problem that needs to be solved in a more accurate and automated way. Several factors determine the cost of claims based on health factors like BMI, age, smoker, health conditions and others. Insurance companies apply numerous techniques for analyzing and predicting health insurance costs.</p>
